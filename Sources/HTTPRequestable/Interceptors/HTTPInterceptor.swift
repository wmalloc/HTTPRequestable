/// Interceptor is a middleware component that can intercept, modify, or observe network requests and responses.
public protocol HTTPInterceptor: Sendable {
  /// A closure type representing the next step in the interceptor chain.
  ///
  /// This typealias is used to forward the current HTTP request, optional body data, and an optional delegate
  /// to the next interceptor or the actual network execution. It allows interceptors to perform pre-processing,
  /// post-processing, or short-circuit the request handling.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - request: The `HTTPRequest` object representing the original or modified outbound HTTP request.
  /// - Returns: An `HTTPAnyResponse` representing the response for the request.
  /// - Throws: Propagates any error thrown by the next interceptor or the underlying network operation.

  /**
   Intercepts an outgoing HTTP request, allowing modification, observation, or short-circuiting of the request before it continues through the interceptor chain.

   Use this method to inspect or alter the outgoing request, modify the request body, provide a custom response, or perform asynchronous work before delegating to the next interceptor. If you do not call `next`, the chain is short-circuited and your response will be returned instead.

   - Parameters:
   - request: The `HTTPRequest` representing the outbound HTTP request to be sent.
   - next: A closure for invoking the next interceptor or performing the actual network operation. Call this with (potentially modified) arguments to continue the chain.

   - Returns: An `HTTPAnyResponse` representing the network response or an interceptor-provided response.

   - Throws: Propagates any error thrown by the next interceptor or the underlying network operation, or throws an error if intercepting fails.

   - Note: If you wish to continue the request with modified values, call `next` using the new values. If you wish to terminate the chain early, do not call `next` and instead return or throw your own response or error.
